# FolderCopyService
# This application is a windows service that copies files from one folder to another.
# It uses a timer to run every hour and checks for new files in the source folder. 
# If it finds new files, it copies them to the destination folder. 
# It also keeps track of the files and folders in the source folder and updates the database with the file and folder details.
